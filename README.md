'''
Credit Card Fraud Detection with Machine Learning is a process of data investigation by a Data Science team and 
the development of a model that will provide the best results in revealing and preventing fraudulent transactions. 
This is achieved through bringing together all meaningful features of card usersâ€™ transactions
